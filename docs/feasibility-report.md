| OS | Ready | Debian 13 (trixie), aarch64 |
| BlueZ | Ready | 5.82 |
| PipeWire | Ready | 1.4.2 |
| WirePlumber | Ready | 0.5.8 |
| imsg | Ready | 0.3.1 |
| Rust | Ready | 1.97.1 |
| ShellCheck | Ready | 0.10.0 |
| obexd | Not installed | imsg uses own OBEX |

## Paired Device Status

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | illuminary-cinema |
| Icon | phone |
| Paired | yes |
| Trusted | yes |
| Connected | yes |
| MAP UUID | advertised |
| PBAP UUID | advertised |
| HFP UUID | advertised |

## Blockers

1. ~~iPhone not trusted~~ — RESOLVED
2. ~~obexd not installed~~ — imsg uses own OBEX, works fine
3. **Bluetooth group** — not active in current session (requires re-login)

## Key Findings

1. MAP works via imsg without needing bluez-obexd
2. PBAP works via imsg without needing bluez-obexd
3. iOS requires manual permission grant (Show Notifications, Share Contacts) before first connection
4. iOS permission prompt appears after first connection attempt
5. imsg connects via its own OBEX implementation (bluer crate)
6. MAP channel: RFCOMM 2, PBAP channel: RFCOMM 13
